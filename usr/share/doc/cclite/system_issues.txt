15. Registry is open or closed (can't automatically partner closed)
    Registry is type: transaction_charge, equal_time etc. like trades with like
16. Currency is open or closed (closed won't appear on pick lists)
17. Need to add checks for easy passwords/pins in validate_xxx

24. 
25. collect_items needs to be general and only collect 'active' items. hacked in for SIC
26. 
27. 
28. 
29. Go through new database and current forms and check for mismatch, new fields
30. majorclass and type changed to varchar in yellow pages, dbi::mysql bug make enum retrieval hard
    remove parastic call in yellow pages directory!

32. In the registry record, geographic coverage description is problematic
    currently, there's space for a list of postcodes: explained in manual

39. SMS payment failure is not correctly dealt with. How to deal without sending more SMS messages?
40. User name should be a single string, no spaces, validate and reject other cases
41. Server error when creating user and registry mistyped..should give error message
42. Display template shouldn't call exit if using mod_perl: take it out?
43. 
44. 
45.
46. Need to add token value to transaction hash, means it's blessed by the server
====================================================
7/2007
1. when not multiregistry can still create registry partner
2. need to do semantic checks (server hello) on partner creation
3. need to do more try/catch for remote transaction (typo in proxy, uri not caught cleanly)
4. remote transaction accept is two stage/local transaction one stage
5. sysaccount and manager shouldn't be shown as users during search
6. need to do a parasitic logoff before new account creation (just in case)
7. activation if another user is logged on (this is a perverse case though)
8. home registry should be first in pick list for multiregistry (ergnomy)
9. create currency should flip back to currency list

20. need only show fields in transaction listing where they are 'foreign'

23. maxreport for balances and volumes should be configurable in cclite.cf, hard coded to 6
24. date problems in yellow pages
25. manager and sysaccount should have current date as creation date
26. confirm trade needs to use hash not trade stamp
27. confirm split needs to be automagical, not two step
28. add a little table to identify transaction colour coding: orange=split, silver=declined etc.
29. rationalise the filtered fields in modify_trade, some are need for 'where' operations,
do in a different way?
30. cclite.cgi should detect no setup for simplicity
31.

soap attempts made...
