5. sysaccount and manager shouldn't be shown as users during search
6. need to do a parasitic logoff before new account creation (just in case)
7. activation if another user is logged on (this is a perverse case though)
8. home registry should be first in pick list for multiregistry (ergnomy)

27. confirm split needs to be automagical, not two step

do in a different way?

(1) "username [from user X willing to trade in tiki through cclite] doesn't match any username in cclite"
(2) "transaction request would exceed the maximum negative budget allowed for user X. 
Contact the cclite trading network (registry) manager [email or link to intratiki messaging to that user] if needed."
(3) "currency name X in Tiki doesn't match any currency name for this trading network (registry)"
(4) The ip address of your tiki installation is not allowed in the Cclite configuration for this trading network. Contact the cclite trading network (registry) manager [email or link to intratiki messaging to that user] if needed."
(5) Message to the cclite registry manager (not to the client tiki?, to avoid robots trynig differnt Merchant Id continuously until matching it]: "The Merchant Id used from ip|user|whatever-info-from-the-client-tiki is invalid".
