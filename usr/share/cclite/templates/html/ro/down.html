Welcome to the test version of cclite. Until you've logged in, you can't do very much! Use a test account or create your own...<br/><br/>

You can use the Nume registru: <i>dalston</i> and Numele de cont: <i>ddawg</i> or <i>mmouse</i> both with Parola: <i>test</i>. The currency <i>ducket</i> is set up for this registry.
<br/><br/>
Also you can use Numele de cont: <i>manager</i> with a Parola: <i>manager</i> at dalston to access the Management Menu.<br/><br/>
You can add new registries and currencies with this. When you are logged in to dalston that currency will be added to dalston, for example.
